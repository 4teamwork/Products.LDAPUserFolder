Installation
============
Products.LDAPUserFolder is installed as an egg using setuptools[1]. It is 
still possible to install it manually by copying the LDAPUserFolder folder 
inside Products/ from the egg into your Zope instance Products/ folder. Do 
not forget to restart Zope afterwards, regardless of installation method 
chosen.

Upgrading
=========
In order to avoid problems everyone who upgrades from a prior version of the 
LDAPUserFolder should delete and recreate any LDAPUserFolder instance they 
have! One easy way of doing so is the GenericSetup[2] export/import route, 
since Products.LDAPUserFolder supports GenericSetup.

Important Hints
===============
If you for some reason decide to run Zope on a certain OS from Redmond
you might have difficulties getting python-ldap in a precompiled 
version. The official python-ldap website[3] lists some sources.
